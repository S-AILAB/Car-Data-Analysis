# Car-Data-Analysis
Prepare the Car Dataset for analysis by identifying and handling missing values and outliers to ensure data quality and consistency

<h1>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
  The goal is to prepare the <strong>Car Dataset</strong> for analysis by identifying and handling missing values and outliers to ensure data quality and consistency.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
  This is an open-ended exercise focused on data cleaning and outlier treatment. You are encouraged to explore various data-cleaning methods and experiment with different techniques for handling missing values and outliers based on your learning from the LMS videos.
</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dataset Name:</strong> car price</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>1. Data Inspection and Summary Statistics</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Load the Dataset:</strong><br>
    Import the Car Dataset and review its basic structure, including column names, data types, and a few initial records.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Generate Summary Statistics:</strong><br>
    Calculate key statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, etc.) to understand the primary characteristics of each column.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Missing Value Treatment</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Identify Missing Values:</strong><br>
    Check for any columns with missing data and assess the extent of missingness.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Handle Missing Data:</strong><br>
    Replace missing values by filling them with the mean of the respective column to maintain data consistency and prevent bias.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Outlier Detection and Treatment</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Detect Outliers:</strong><br>
    Use statistical methods, such as the Interquartile Range (IQR), to identify any extreme values that might be outliers.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Treat Outliers:</strong><br>
    Adjust extreme values by capping or transforming them to fall within a reasonable range. This helps create a balanced dataset, enhancing the reliability of further analysis.
  </li>
</ul>
